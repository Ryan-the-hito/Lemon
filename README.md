# üçãLemon: A Web Tool for Cleaner Chinese

![Title](https://github.com/Ryan-the-hito/Lemon/raw/main/img/Lemon_Title.png)

**Lemon** is a local app for generating .js scripts to block dirty Chinese words on browsers.

(‚ö†Ô∏è The app might be only working on Apple Silicon devices...at least for now.)

**LemonJuice** is the .js file that should be installed in the browser.
